### For the project to build, these files must exist with exact filenames:

public/index.html is the page template;

src/index.js is the JavaScript entry point.

## Available Scripts:

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any errors in the console.

### npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about running tests for more information.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### npm run eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
